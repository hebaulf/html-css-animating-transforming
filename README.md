For this project I made a landing page showing my skill levels in front end development.  

For my animated elements without interaction I used fade-in and slide-up motion for the content with different delays. I also made a float up bubble background with 12 bubbles with various delay and duration and `animation-iteration-count: infinite;`. 

For the animated elements with interaction I made hover transformation on the social icons where they change to the color of each media company color and I also made a javascript function for a bubble that follows the mouse arrow around the viewport.  

The page is responsive and also the heading and name for each skill has a responsive font size.
